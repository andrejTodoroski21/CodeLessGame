This game was made without any code just so i can learn the basics of the unity engine
The game consists of a maze and a ball. The objective is to get the ball to the endpoint and click it with your mouse
As the game starts youll notice background music playing and a completion sound when you win the game. I acheived this by downloading sound files from a website and adding it to my game.
There are buttons on the left, right and middle of the screen. When either of the left or right buttons are pressed the entire arena moves to the side you pressed, and the button in the middle is a pause button that will stop the movement of the arena.
